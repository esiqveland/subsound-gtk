# TODO

## General
Merge GSongInfo and GQueueItem:
 - this is to have a single place to update the currently playing and if the song is favorited via GObject signals.

- AlbumSongActionRow: remove the play button and instead add a "menu" button (three dots icon),
which opens a context menu with options to enqueue/queue next/favorite/add to playlist/add to download queue

- AlbumPage: Add a button to download all songs in the album ("make available offline")

- Split the playqueue into separate priorities, where user queued is higher priority than
automatically queued based on clicking on a song.

- List downloaded songs in the playlist page

- List an overview of downloaded songs and cached content from the sever on the configuration popover in the upper right corner.

- Try to use the database as a backing store for the CachingClient

- Try to use the database as a backing store for the PlayQueue, so we can persist the queue across restarts.
