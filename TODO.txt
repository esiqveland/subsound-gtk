## General
Merge GSongInfo and GQueueItem:
 - this is to have a single place to update the currently playing and if the song is favorited via GObject signals.

- AlbumSongActionRow: remove the play button and instead add a "menu" button (three dots icon),
which opens a context menu with options to enqueue/queue next/favorite/add to playlist/add to download queue

- AlbumPage: Add a button to download all songs in the album ("make available offline")

- Split the playqueue into separate priorities, where user queued is higher priority than
automatically queued based on clicking on a song.

So when a user adds a song to the playqueue, it should be prioritized higher than the automatically queued songs.
so when its added to the end, it should be added to the end of user added songs, or if no such songs exist,
it should be added as the next song to play.
