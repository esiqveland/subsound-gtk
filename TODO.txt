## General
Merge GSongInfo and GQueueItem:
 - this is to have a single place to update the currently playing and if the song is favorited via GObject signals.

- AlbumSongActionRow: remove the play button and instead add a "menu" button (three dots icon),
which opens a context menu with options to enqueue/queue next/favorite/add to playlist/add to download queue

- AlbumPage: Add a button to download all songs in the album ("make available offline")
