# TODO

## General
Merge GSongInfo and GQueueItem:
 - this is to have a single place to update the currently playing and if the song is favorited via GObject signals.

GSongInfo:
 - [ ] extend is-playing to a richer playing state

- Find a way to add the context menu to the items in the playlist page + button to remove from playlist

- AlbumPage: Add a button to download all songs in the album ("make available offline")
    - add a button to download all songs in the playlist

- downloads:
  - need to store the format we downloaded mp3/opus/flac
  - need to store the quality we downloaded high/medium/low
  - need to show the format/quality and file size in the playlist page
  - delete button?
  - potentially add a way to check the status of downloaded files on disk
  - fix the downloaded count in the playlist sidebar

- List an overview of downloaded songs and cached content from the server on the configuration popover in the upper right corner
    - Add a button to sync data from the server

- Try to use the database as a backing store for the CachingClient

playqueue:
- database as a backing store for the PlayQueue, so we can persist the queue across restarts.



## DONE

- [X] List downloaded songs in the playlist page

playqueue:
- [X] Split the playqueue into separate priorities, where user queued is higher priority than
automatically queued based on clicking on a song.

- [X] AlbumSongActionRow: remove the play button and instead add a "menu" button (three dots icon),
which opens a context menu with options to enqueue/queue next/favorite/add to playlist/add to download queue
